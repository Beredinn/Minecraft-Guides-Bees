There are lots of different bees, especially if you have Binnie’s Mods: Extra Bees, Gendustry and Magic Bees. While most bees will give you general byproducts such as ores, gems, honey and crafting materials, there are some bees that interact with the world (aside from auras such as regen and exp gain). While I could list all the bees and their byproducts, it is far easier to look this up in JEI (looking up “comb” will help as most ores from combs will be in “tiny piles” format).

There are also a few spreadsheets you can find that have a complete list of bee species and their by products: [Master Apiarist Database v2.0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_moZHLnL35_u-bJ7kFDxWDxY9OuMWK_4l0EB4wIx0_s/edit?type=view&gid=1&f=true&sortcolid=-1&sortasc=true&rowsperpage=250#gid=0).

**Student Bees** - "Will this be on the final test?"
* Common + Cultivated (requires a bookshelf as a foundation).

A student bee’s Drone can be sneak-right-clicked onto an apiary and will alert when the queen is gone.

**Sharpening Bees** - "If on your journey, you should encounter God... God will be cut."
* Graduate + Armorer

_Sharpening_: Sharpens weapons placed on nearby Flower Pedestals.

This will provide up to a 100% bonus to the weapon damage of most weapons, including the custom weapons from Tinkers’ Construct. Note that if you sharpen up to the cap of a Tinkers weapon and then replace the tool head (or other part that provides damage) with something with a higher base damage rating, you will not be able to sharpen it further.

**Lumber Bees** - "I'm a Lumber Bee and I'm okay."
* Graduate + Forest

_Bark Biter_: Bites small pieces of bark off of nearby trees. The trees are not permanently harmed by this, and the pieces of bark can be crafted into full logs. These are deposited into the Apiary/Alveary.

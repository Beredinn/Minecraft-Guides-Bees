There are 20 frames in the FTB Revelation Mod Pack. Frames allow you to do a variety of things when placed in an apiary. Most increase the production speed of a bee by double, and can be stacked for plenty of benefits. The main stats frames have are, Production, Lifetime, Durability, Genetic Decay, Mutation Chance and Territory.

Production, Lifespan, Territory, and Durability are all self explanatory: Production modifies bee output, Lifespan modifies the queen’s lifespan, Durability is how many cycles a frame will last, and Territory modifies the bee’s territory range. Genetic Decay modifies how often Ignoble Stock queens will die out. Mutation Chance modifies the percentage change a bee will mutate into a new species.

For example, a frame with 2.0x Production, 1.1x Lifespan, 0.8x Genetic Decay, and 80 Durability will give your queen double the production speed, an additional 10 percent lifespan, and a bonus of 20 percent to not randomly die out if she is Ignoble Stock. It will last 80 cycles (or 2200 seconds). Putting in 3 of these frames increases these bonuses to 6 times (30 percent lifespan, and 60 percent less genetic decay) respectively. Durability does not stack, as all frames will use it up simultaneously.

When wandering around in your world you will no doubt notice the various different types of Bee Hives scattered throughout different Biomes and even underground or underwater. These are Bee Hives. They contain bees, and if you get too close to some of these, you will get stung and take a little bit of Damage. Some bees do direct damage to you, and others poison you. 

Some bees do not stack because they have different attributes (we will cover this in more detail later).

When you hover over bees you will notice that each says “Unknown.” This is normal when first starting out, and each new bee you get in the future will also say this. You will learn more about these bees later.

So what else can bees do? Well, apart from give you Delicious Honey Bread, they can also give you:
* Resources
* Protection
* Status Effects
* Automation
* Animal Breeding

**Mundane Bees**
